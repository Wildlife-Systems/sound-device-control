# sdc: sound device control for Raspberry Pi
This bash script allows for control of various Raspberry Pi sound cards using a simple and standardised interface. The script was developed as part of the Automated Acoustic Observatories project and simplifies the automated control of audio collection when using a network of Raspberry Pi devices with a heterogenous set of sound devices.
